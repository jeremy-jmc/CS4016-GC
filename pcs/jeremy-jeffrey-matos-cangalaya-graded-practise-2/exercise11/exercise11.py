Write a function that computes the area of a convex polygon.

IDEA:
   Cross product of two vectors gives the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors.
    The area of a triangle is half of the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors.
    The area of a convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the triangles formed by the first vertex and two consecutive vertices.
